# WGAN


This project is one of my assignments due to learning about different types of GAN for generating data.
You can read the whole article about WGAN [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875).
Wasserstein GAN, or WGAN, is a type of generative adversarial network but is an innovative improvement to traditional GANs.
While traditional GANs, with their competing generator and discriminator models, are able to achieve massive success, there were several cases of failure of these networks.
Two of the most common reasons were due to either a convergence failure or a mode collapse. In convergence failure, the model failed to produce optimal or good quality results. In the case of a mode collapse, the model failed to produce unique images repeating a similar pattern or quality. Hence, to solve some of these issues or to combat numerous types of problems, there were gradually many variations and versions developed for GANs. WGAN offers higher stability to the training model in comparison to simple GAN architectures. The loss function utilized in WGAN also gives us a termination criterion for evaluating the model. While it may sometimes take slightly longer to train, it is one of the better options to achieve more efficient results.
